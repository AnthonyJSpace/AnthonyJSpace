## About me

I’m a lifelong hobbyist programmer with roots going all the way back to the ZX81 and Sinclair BASIC in the early '80s. From the Commodore Amiga to modern PCs, I’ve explored a wide range of languages and platforms — including Turbo Pascal, Delphi, C, C++, C#, and Python.

I’ve recently completed a Data Engineering bootcamp, sharpening my skills in Python, SQL, and Apache Spark. I also have experience as a business analyst, working with Excel, Power Query, and Power BI to turn data into insights.

I solve problems for the love of it — always learning and experimenting.
